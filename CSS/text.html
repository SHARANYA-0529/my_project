    <p class="para">Suraram, a suburb of Hyderabad, has seen significant development in recent years, particularly in terms of infrastructure and residential projects. The area is characterized by a mix of older, established neighborhoods and newer, modern apartment complexes. While it retains a somewhat quieter atmosphere compared to the bustling city center, it's well-connected to major parts of Hyderabad via roads and public transport.
As of July 2, 2025, the summer heat is intense in Suraram, with temperatures soaring well into the high 30s Celsius (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit). Local businesses, especially those focused on food and beverages, are likely experiencing a surge in demand for cooling products like ice cream and refreshing drinks. The daily routine in Suraram is likely adjusted to the heat, with people preferring indoor activities or venturing out during the cooler parts of the day.
